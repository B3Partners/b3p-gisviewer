New install or updating ?
=========================

- When using a new gis suite generate your own schema export
- Before creating a schema export adjust your mapping to Postgres/Oracle
- When updating run the scripts in the corresponding update folder

Adding scripts to folders
=========================

- Do not commit schema exports
- Add a numbered prefix to your sql script file name
- Make sure there is a Postgres and Oracle version if applicable
- Add scripts in the applicable versioned folder
- Also place a corresponding script in the update folder to that version
